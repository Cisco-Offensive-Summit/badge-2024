The 2024 badge Schematic and Layout started from the 2023 badge; it uses the same technology (4 layer PCB5 mil minimum trace and space)

The changelist, taken from the badge group meeting requests 8-23-2023:

Change Processor to ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8, 1965-ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8CT-ND 
Add a 2nd E-inc SPI screen - (Recommend E2200CS021-ND instead of 1528-1028-ND for better availablility and less cost; avoids ada-fruit parts)
Add a E-inc screen connector - (609-1200-2-ND)
Remove all Cap sense Buttons
Add (4) RGB LED Thruhole (COM-12986, COM-12999, COM12877 by sparkfun which uses same WS2812 protocol as magtag)
Add (4) Thru Hole Hard Buttons (use PTS636 SL43 LFS buttons), and make all buttons thruhole (include S1, S2)
Include QWIIC, Stemma QT connector, and Stemma connector (Qwiic, Stemma QT - SM04B-SRSS-TB, Stemma - 455-S4B-PH-SM4-TBTR-ND)
Change to ESP32-S3 for direct USB comms,
Change all Testpoints to match the IO port they are connected to (IO4-->TP4, IO41 -->TP41, etc.)
Keep the  Micro LIPO module, do not Add LIPO Battery charger circuit - (MCP73831T-2ACI)
Keep the Micro LIPO module, do not Change Battery footprint to LIPO connector - (455-1719-ND)
Keep the Micro LIPO module, do not change P5 to direct USB header 2073-USB4105-GF-ATR-ND







2024 Badge REV 0 to REV1 modifications:

DONE 1.  Addressable LED thruholes are not big enough!!
DONE 2.  The schematic description for R10 is incorrect; it says RES SMD 1K OHM 5% 1/10W 0603 but its actually RES SMD 2K OHM 5% 1/10W 0603!!!
DONE 3.  The schematic description for R8, R9 is incorrect; it says RES SMD 47K OHM 5% 1/10W 0603 but its actually RES 10K OHM 5% 1/10W 0603!!!
DONE 4.  The thruholes for the removable pins (P2, P5) are too small!!  The first two of the P2 display connector are big enough, change the rest in P2 and P5 to match!!
NC 5.  Fun Suggestion - The orange LED on the Front is D2, if we make the resistor for it R2 then we can arrange it to say R2/D2 on the PCB!!!
DONE 6.  Label S2 as RESET on the PCB!!
DONE 7.  Label S3 as BOOTLOADER on the PCB!!
NC 8.  S1 does not sit flat on the PCB.  Add cutouts for the positioning bosses to S1!!  
DONE 9.  Add polarity markers to the LED's on top of the board (D3, D4, D5, D6)!! 
DONE 10. P3 pinout and part is not correct.  Currently it expects a top insertion FPC cable and expects pin1 to be in the magtag position.  The new screen requires bottom insertion FPC and the pin1 of the is on the opposite side as the magtag.  Swap the pin order of P3 and change the component to a bottom insertion FPC!!
DONE 11. P3 position is not correct.  The magtag screen has a cable that is ~4mm longer than the E2200CS021.  Move P3 closer to the board edge (by about 4mm)!!
DONE 12. There are no convenient places to access GND or 3.3V, add some GND and 3.3V testpoints!!
DONE 13. The label for TP18 is confusing; I probed on TP8 for over an hour before I figured out I was on TP8.  Move TP18 label to the ESP side of the test point row and align correctly.
