### Research for plastic standoffs:

#### Goal:   
To find plastic standoff solution(s) such that the mounting hardware is less expensive and easier to assemble (no screws!!).  

#### Result:  
1.  The backing plate thickness is currently .100" and our PCB thickness is .062."  There were no catalog solutions to join these different thicknesses for the current thruhole diameter (.150").
2.  The PCB holes for the Micro Lipo module are currently .075" and mounting holes on the micro lipo module are .100."  There were no catalog solutions to join these different thruhole diameter sizes.

#### Recommendation:  
1.  Decrease the backing plate thickness to .062."
2.  Increase the badge PCB thruhole diameter for the Micro Lipo PCB to .100."
3.  Use the parts listed below:


| Standoff            | Quantity |  Digikey Part | Comment | 
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------- |
| TFT Screen Standoff | 4        |  732-10356-ND |  Tested Good and works!!!       |
| PCB Standoff        | 4        |  (Double Check in lab)  |  Tested OK on PCB side only, adjust backing plate thickness to .062"!!! |
| Micro Lipo Standoff | 4        |  145-27MMP004-ND | Tested OK on Micro Lipo side only, adjust PCB thruhole diameter to .100"!!! |
