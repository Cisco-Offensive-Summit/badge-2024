	// Changes the displayed image from some previous image to the given image.
	// - If the argument prevPix is not null, then it is used
	//   as the previous image (only read, not written).
	// - Else if the field previousImage is not null,
	//   then it is used as the previous image.
	// - Otherwise with both prevPix and previousImage
	//   being null, this method returns an error.
	// 
	// All elements of both the previous and current image arrays must have initialized values,
	// because the arrays will be read. (For example, it is unacceptable to allocate the previous
	// image array on the stack or with malloc(), without setting a value on each element.)
	// 
	// Four images are drawn to the screen in sequence: the negative of the previous image, an all-
	// white screen, the negative of the given image, and finally the positive of the given image.
	// If previousImage is not null (regardless of the value of prevPix), then the given
	// image is copied to previousImage, which may be read on the next call to changeImage().
	// 
	// All image arrays follow these rules:
	// - Array length is equal to width * height / 8, which must be an integer.
	// - Each bit represents a monochrome pixel. 0 means white, and 1 means black.
	// - The pixel at (x, y) (with both coordinates counting from 0), letting
	//   i = y * width + x, is stored at byte index floor(i / 8) (counting from 0),
	//   bit index i % 8 (where 0 is the least significant bit and 7 is the most significant).
	//   In other words, pixel bits are packed into bytes in little endian,
	//   and the 2D array is mapped into 1D in row-major order.
	// - There are no padding/ignored/wasted bits. Every bit affects the visible image.

	// This method updates exactly the pixels on screen where the given image differs from the previous image,
	// and doesn't make the whole screen flicker. But image quality may be degraded around the edges
	// of changed pixels, so it's a good idea to use changeImage() periodically for a clean redraw.
