## Enclosure models for 3D printing

For one badge you need one print of each of 4 stl files. There are different STL files for 2024 and 2025 edition badges - the difference is only with the EPD (e-paper) screen size.

- 2024 - wide EPD screen
- 2025 - square EPD screen

They are named "bAIdge" as they were created for the bAIdge (badge AI assistant) app setup (with microphone and speakers) - but can be used for other usecases (e.g. just the speaker to play with sequencer app).
